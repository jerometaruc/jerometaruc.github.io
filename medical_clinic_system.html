            Welcome to the Medical Clinic Management System!
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was developed as part of the SENG265 course at the University of Victoria. I collaborated with a partner to design and implement a system that streamlines patient management for medical professionals, offering features such as patient sign-ins/outs, detailed record keeping, and efficient data storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system's user interface was built using PyQt6, providing an intuitive and seamless experience. We implemented modular backend code to ensure scalability and maintainability and used DAOJSON and DAOPickle for reliable data persistence.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Extensive testing and debugging made this system robust and capable of handling complex data interactions, demonstrating my ability to work effectively in a team and deliver software solutions for real-world applications.  
        </p>
