          Hi, I'm Jerome Taruc!
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria, passionate about software development and solving real-world problems through technology. My academic journey has given me hands-on experience in Python, Java, and C, as well as web development with HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
          When I'm not busy with schoolwork, you can usually find me rock climbing, lifting weights, or playing Super Smash Bros with my roommates. I'm also a huge fan of basketball—especially the Los Angeles Lakers—and love watching games whenever I get the chance.  
      </p>
      <p>
          I've always been into video games, with Pokémon and Zelda being all-time favorites. A few years ago, I even built my own gaming PC, which has been perfect for exploring new games and diving deeper into tech.  
      </p>
      <p>
